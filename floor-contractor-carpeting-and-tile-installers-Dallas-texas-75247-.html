There are some options here. Clean up the spilled compound instantly, getting as much of it up as you can. Next, use some floor cleaner to look after any residues. There are sprays created for carpeting that can help rather a bit. Once the floor dries, it should hopefully be as stain-free as possible.</p><p>As you can see, looking after your floorings, even if you have kids, isn't a difficult task.
